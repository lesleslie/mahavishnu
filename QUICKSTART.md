## 🚀 Next Steps (When You Get Back)

### 1. Install OpenSearch (5 minutes)
```bash
brew install opensearch
brew services start opensearch

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:9200

# Install Python dependencies
uv pip install 'llama-index-vector-stores-opensearch'
uv pip install opensearch-py
```

### 2. Start Phase 0.1: Code Graph Analyzer
**File to create:** `mcp-common/code_graph/analyzer.py`

```python
"""Shared code graph analyzer - used by Session Buddy and Mahavishnu"""
import ast
from pathlib import Path
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class FunctionNode:
    """Function or method"""
    id: str
    name: str
    file_id: str
    is_export: bool
    start_line: int
    end_line: int
    calls: list[str]

class CodeGraphAnalyzer:
    """Analyze and index codebase structure"""

    def __init__(self, project_path: Path):
        self.project_path = project_path

    async def analyze_repository(self, repo_path: str) -> dict:
        """Analyze repository and build code graph."""
        # TODO: Implement AST parsing
        return {
            "files_indexed": 0,
            "functions_indexed": 0,
            "classes_indexed": 0
        }
```

### 3. Write First Test
**File to create:** `mcp-common/tests/test_code_graph.py`

```python
import pytest
from mcp_common.code_graph import CodeGraphAnalyzer

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_analyze_simple_repository(tmp_path):
    """Test analyzing a simple Python repository"""
    # Create test files
    (tmp_path / "test.py").write_text("""
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
""")

    analyzer = CodeGraphAnalyzer(tmp_path)
    stats = await analyzer.analyze_repository(str(tmp_path))

    assert stats["files_indexed"] == 1
    assert stats["functions_indexed"] == 1
```

### 4. Run Test
```bash
cd /Users/les/Projects/mcp-common
pytest tests/test_code_graph.py -v
```

## 🎯 This Week's Goals

**Week 1 (Jan 25 - Jan 31):**

### Must Complete:
- [ ] Install OpenSearch via Homebrew
- [ ] Create `mcp-common/code_graph/analyzer.py` skeleton
- [ ] Write first test for code graph
- [ ] Create DevOps documentation templates

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Complete basic AST parsing
- [ ] Test OpenSearch prototype (ingest 100 docs)
- [ ] Set up basic CI/CD pipeline

---

## 🔗 Quick Links

**Main Plan:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Full roadmap with all details
**Progress:** `PROGRESS.md` - Check off tasks as you go
**Reviews:** `COMMITTEE_REVIEW_STATUS.md` - All committee feedback

**Key Files:**
- `pyproject.toml` - mcp-common dependency already added ✅
- `mcp-common/messaging/types.py` - Shared types already created ✅
- `mcp-common/mcp/contracts/code_graph_tools.yaml` - Tool contracts ✅

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with OpenSearch prototype first** (validates technical approach early)
2. **Keep tests simple** - unit tests over integration tests initially
3. **Update PROGRESS.md daily** - track what you've done
4. **Ask for help** - reference committee reviews if stuck

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't skip OpenSearch security** - Phase 0.5 requires TLS/auth
2. **Don't defer testing** - write tests alongside code (TDD)
3. **Don't ignore DevOps docs** - they're required for production
4. **Don't forget cross-project auth** - HMAC signatures needed

---

## 🎉 Celebration Milestones

- [ ] **First commit:** Code graph analyzer skeleton
- [ ] **First test passing:** `test_analyze_simple_repository`
- [ ] **OpenSearch working:** Can ingest 100 docs
- [ ] **Phase 0 complete:** All 20 tasks done
- [ ] **Security hardening done:** TLS + auth working
- [ ] **First cross-project message:** Session Buddy ↔ Mahavishnu
- [ ] **First real workflow:** Prefect executing actual flow
- [ ] **First Agno agent:** Agent running and completing task
- [ ] **Production ready:** All 116 tasks complete 🚀

**Enjoy your walk! See you when you get back! ☕**

**Remember:** The committee approved this plan because it addresses ALL their concerns. Take it one phase at a time and you'll be production-ready in 19-22 weeks!
