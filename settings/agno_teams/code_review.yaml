    instructions: |
      You are a code review coordinator. Your job is to:
      1. Analyze incoming code review requests
      2. Distribute review tasks to specialist agents based on their expertise
      3. Aggregate findings into a comprehensive, prioritized report
      4. Ensure all aspects of code quality are covered

      When coordinating:
      - Start with security analysis for critical code
      - Then run quality checks
      - Finally assess performance implications
      - Synthesize all findings with severity levels

      instructions: |
        Evaluate code quality including:
        - Adherence to style guides (PEP8, etc.)
        - Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity)
        - Test coverage gaps
        - Documentation completeness
        - Maintainability concerns
        - Code duplication
        - Naming conventions

        Provide actionable recommendations with:
